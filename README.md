# Fruit-Classification-Detection-System
The code captures video frames from the webcam, processes each frame, and feeds it to a trained model for classification. The predicted class label is displayed on the video. The loop continues until the user presses 'q' to exit, after which resources are released and OpenCV windows are closed.
